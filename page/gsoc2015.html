				<h1>Google Summer of Code 2015</h1>

				<p>
					Welcome to the SCoRe Lab Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015 project ideas page. We are a dynamic and enthusiastic nonprofit research group pioneering in Internet of Things (IOT), Embedded Systems, Computer Security and 'Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks' and is one of the best groups in South Asia. We are based in the University of Colombo School of Computing, Sri Lanka. This is the first time that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above mentioned areas. Please note that anyone who is interested can participate in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest possible project ideas. You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to improve or heip you with them. Please keep in mind that projects need to be realistically something that is able to be functionally completed by a student working full time for about eight weeks. Thanks!

				<h2>OpenDF</h2>
				
				<p>An effort to build an Open Source tool to help Digital Forensics Investigations by bringing all the related processes in digital forensics into one complete solution.

  			<div id="opendf-1">
				<h3>   1. Forensics Timeline Module</h3>
				<p>Develop a module that can visually represent, in user friendly way, the activities recorded in a Disk Image, like file access activities, browser histories, etc. This should extract different kind of  time series data and represent in a way that the investigators can get an indea of the last activities done on a given Disk Image.

				<br>

			<div id="opendf-2">
				<h3>   2. Auto-Installer and Easy Deployments</h3>
				<p> Auto installer should install the db script and create an admin account with the details provided by the user. It should also display the User Agreement and get user agreed to the terms before initialization. This includes setting up organisation details, report header templates etc.</p>
				<p> Since this task is little bit easy, we like you to work on Easy Deployments task also. The ideas is to use <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to let anyone spawn an OpenDF configured VM within minutes. What has to be done is, write some shell scripts to install needed platforms( Git, Java, Glashfish, etc ) on top of a Linux distro and exposing the application to the outer environment. We can shre this Vagrant configuration on <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/share/">Vagrant Share</a>. Then anyone who likes to use OpenDF can simply use <code>vegrant up</code> command and visit the url from the user's browser once the VM successfully started

			<div id="opendf-3">
				<h3>  3. Browser Data Module</h3>
				<p>Develop a web browser data module for OpenDF using the Sleuth Kit's browser data extractions feature.  Browser data may include  browser history, cookies, saved passwords, browser bookmarks, etc. You should find a way to present these data in user friendly way.
				<br>

			<div id="opendf-4">
				<h3>  3. Image,video & audio metadata Module</h3>
				<p>Develop a module for OpenDF to  extract meta data of images( Photos ),video & audio and present in user friendly way. There are several Photographic Metadata Standards like, Exif ( Exchangeable image file format ), etc. Your task is to query for media files and extract these metadata from them. This should be done in whole or for a given media file. And these data should be presented to the user while browsing the files on the Disk Images.

				<br>
			<div id="opendf-4">
				<h3>   4. Test Automation</h3>
				<p>GSoC is not only about developing, it is also about testing! We need a mechanism to automate the functional testing, something like Selenium may be ideal ( Cucumber test framework may also be a good fit ). If we can have a test script, a continious intrigation tool can execute these tests for every build. Therefor the task is to come up with a suitable test automation mechanism and start writing the test scripts. ( You can refer the OpenDF's test documents to get an idea of test cases. )

				<h2>Redesign TikiriDB</h2>
				<p>
					TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer to enable a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting up the sensor network with TikiriDB It is possible to gather data without having the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to comply with sensor network environment. TikiriDB system is composed in three parts on is installed in sensor nodes, one is installed in base-stations and the other is installed in computer connected with the base-station. The application installed in computer will provide an API to connect the your application with the database. Query processor of TikiriDB is located at sensor node. The other part which installed in base-station node will mainly handle the routing of the queries. In this project main objective is make TikiriDB compatible with newer Contiki vision.

				<h2>Social Networks for situation mining</h2>
				<p>
					The given dataset was collected from news groups who had shared their news in Twitter news blogs. These data includes different type of news areas and news topics. By analysing the news, one can define the current state of that given country. In order to make ease to follow the news, the suggestion is to cluster the news into their areas and topics. Several clustering techniques can be use to solve this problem. Thus, the research question is, to identify the news topics among the news and summarize the situation of the given country. The selected data set contains Sri Lanka news and it was collected by using 5 news providers.

			<h2>IoT Datastore powered by Distributed Software Transactional memory</h2>
				
			<p>One of the challenges associated with the internet of things is figuring out where to put all that data. If you have dozens of connected devices talking to the cloud you’ve got to think about where that data lives, how to normalize it and how to grant others access to it so it becomes useful. The goal of this project is to optimize read/write operations in such data store which can be used as a platform to build concurrent systems. Software Transactional Memories (STMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm to develop concurrent applications. By relishing the programmer from the burden of managing locks or other low-level concurrency control mechanisms, the reliability of the code is increased and the software development time significantly shortened.		
			</p>
			<br/> 
			<p>
				<b>Deliverables: </b>
				<ul>
					<li>Model IoT data in single data framework (You can use existing tools)</li> 
					<li>Implement STM on cluster nodes which can plug into above framework</li> 
					<li>Solve conflicts between STMs running on different nodes of the cluster which requires nodes to obtain exclusive access to the datastore during the commit phase</li> 
					<li>Build a debug tool to explore performance metrics</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Skills Needed: </b>
				<br/> - Basic concepts behind Software Transactional Memory, Modeling dynamic data using existing data-structures
