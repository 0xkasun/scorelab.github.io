				<h1>Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2015</h1>

				<p>
					Welcome to the Scorelab Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015 project ideas page. We are a dynamic and enthusiastic nonprofit research group pioneering in Internet of Things (IOT), Embedded Systems, Computer Security and 'Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networks' and is one of the best groups in South Asia. We are based in the University of Colombo, School of Computing, Sri Lanka. This is the first time that we are participating in the GSoC, we will use this page to develop possible project ideas that have on the above mentioned areas. Please note that anyone who is interested can participate in this process. You do not have to be a GSoC student or mentor to suggest possible project ideas. You can also talk to us about possible project ideas and we are happy to improve or heip you with them. Please keep in mind that projects need to be realistically something that is able to be functionally completed by a student working full time for about eight weeks. Thanks!

				<h5>Redesign TikiriDB </h5>
				<p>
					TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer to enable a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting up the sensor network with TikiriDB It is possible to gather data without having the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to comply with sensor network environment. TikiriDB system is composed in three parts on is installed in sensor nodes, one is installed in base-stations and the other is installed in computer connected with the base-station. The application installed in computer will provide an API to connect the your application with the database. Query processor of TikiriDB is located at sensor node. The other part which installed in base-station node will mainly handle the routing of the queries. In this project main objective is make TikiriDB compatible with newer contiki vision.

				<h5>Introduce HTML5 base user interface to the FIT4D</h5>

				<p>
					FIT4D is a software toolkit which is specially designed for digital forensic investigations done in developing countries. It is a clear set of guidelines which are appropriate for solving any type of computer related cyber crimes in developing country like Sri Lanka. This document provides the outline of the forensic analysis model and the general forensic analysis procedure carried out by the forensic examiners using FIT4D. FIT4D contains features such as case management, disk image extraction, data carving and recovery, data categorization, providing more simple views for data analysis and some search functionalities in version 1. Some additional features are going to be added in the future versions such as artificial intelligence and data mining integrations. FIT4D will best fit to the current investigation procedure carried out by the forensic experts in Sri Lanka and it will utilize existing resources. Furthermore it will be enriched with a user friendly interface which will help police officers/any user with poor computer literacy to identify evidence in earlier stages of the investigation process before going to a forensic expert. Furthermore it can be easily expanded to include any number of additional phases required in the future. In this project main objective is provide new HTML5 based user interface to the FIT4D

				<h5>Social Networks for situation mining</h5>
				<p>
					The given dataset was collected from news groups who had shared their news in Twitter news blogs. These data includes different type of news areas and news topics. By analysing the news, one can define the current state of that given country. In order to make ease to follow the news, the suggestion is to cluster the news into their areas and topics. Several clustering techniques can be use to solve this problem. Thus, the research question is, to identify the news topics among the news and summarize the situation of the given country. The selected data set contains Sri Lanka news and it was collected by using 5 news providers.

					<h4>Important Guidelines on Submitting Ideas</h4>
					<br />
					<h6>There are some important guidelines to submit ideas, please read these carefully before adding your ideas:</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>
							There is a fixed time period for implementing and coding your ideas. The GSoC is from May 19th to August 18th 2014.
						</li>
						<li>
							Come up with attainable goals and you will be able to complete what you set out to do. You can always contact our mentors and community and get an idea about the workload and whether you might be able to complete them.
						</li>
						<li>
							The ideas should be about Internet of Things (IOT), Embedded Systems, Computer Security and 'Wireless Adhoc and Sensor Networksâ€™ you are free to come up with your own ideas and also if you love to work on any of these subjects but do not have an idea you can always contact us.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lets Talk! The best way to solve problems that you might have is to contact our mentors and also our community.  This will help you to not get bogged down in your ideas and to move on.
						</li>
						<li>
							We encourage you to do documentation so that we can keep track of your progress and also help you if things are not going according to plan. Although not compulsory we have a strong belief that this method can cut down your time to code and also the workload of the mentors drastically.
						</li>
					</ul>
