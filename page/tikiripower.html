				<h2>Tikiri Power</h2>
				<br />

				<p>
					Today, the significance of the SCORE as a research team has been enhanced by its' new branch of research: Industry Collaboration. Initializing the collaboration, pioneering state of art electrical solutions providing company, O|RANGE ELECTRIC (Orel (MFG) Pvt ltd), join hands with SCORE, aims to provide sustainable electrical solutions through advanced research.
				</p>

				<p>
					“TikiriPower”: a power monitoring system with enhanced capabilities for power monitoring and controlling using smart phones, web interfaces and tablet PCs, was introduced as the first state of art electrical solution under the collaboration.
				</p>

				<p>
					Being specialist in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), SCORE had urged the intention of employing conventional theories of WSN not just for a deployment but in a real-world scenario. Accomplishing the intention, TikiriPower is well equipped with implementation of the conventional theories of WSN. SCORE's TikiriDB: a database abstraction for WSN, blend with Contiki: an operating system for WSN master crafted the backbone of TikiriPower to become the first ever WSN integrated power solution in WSN research domain.
				</p>

				<p>
					TikiriPower consists of power metering, remote monitoring and power controlling capabilities. It has the capability of observing the power consumption details of a building and controlling the devices attached to it. The power related measuring parameters such as Phase Voltage, Line Voltage, Phase Current, and kWh etc. of a selected building is attained by the power meter readings in detail.
				</p>

				<p>
					SCORE intends to enhance the system capabilities by adding power signature analysis (through NILM), load side power management and power scheduling into the system. Advantage of power signature analysis is that the total cost of the equipment’s can be effectively reduced by obtaining individual device wise power consumption through monitoring only the total power consumption. For the load side power management, capability of switching into an intelligent smart home system by adding some decision making scenarios into the system software would be available. On the other hand power scheduling will be done by integrating sensors into the system to ensure time and availability based on device power switching.
