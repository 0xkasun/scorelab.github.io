				<h6>Voice Learning (VoLe) Portal: </h6>

				<p>
					Sri Lankan government and private sectors have invested on public the Internet accessible places such as Internet cafes, Public Internet Kiosk etc. But some of these solutions are not possible for underprivileged users as they are also costly.
				</p>

				<p>
					Since mobile technologies have been rapidly growing and people make use of their mobile devices to access the web anywhere in the world. This will reduce the overhead of buying a PC, the Internet connection and the expenditure of electricity. But accessing mobile Internet is also costly, which is not affordable for the people in developing regions. Apart from that, accessing the Internet through mobile devices also has some limitations. Such as buying a featured phone is an issue for general population. At the same time, the GSM/GPRS coverage does not exist in everywhere. The mobile device is not always user friendly since it has small screen and tiny keypad. All of these limitations will distract people accessing the web through their hand-held devices.
				</p>

				<p>
					All the above mentioned techniques browse the Internet visually through graphical user interface (GUI). Some researchers have explored the possibility of accessing the web through voice communication. The basic voice communication has had larger penetration among the world population as well as in Sri Lanka. IBM Research Laboratory has conducted a research, which build voice web. This concept is called World Wide Telecom Web (WWTW). In this model, the voice sites are developed instead of general web sites. Those voice sites are implemented using a language called VoiceXML. VoiceXML is a markup language derived from XML. Users are allowed to call to the voice site which is a collection of VoiceXML pages through their telephones. However, in this system users have to build separate voice sites and it may not going to happen. Thus we thought of implementing a Voice Learning (VoLe) portal which provides a voice interface to the existing learning web site.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, a user can take a phone call to VoLe and tell that he needs to browse Wikipedia entry for Robotics. Then the VoLe will retrieve the required page and read it to the user. In the other example, a user would like to take ICT quiz available on the UCSC web site. Then the user takes a call and tells it to the VoLe. VoLe will read each question to the user and the user tells the answer. Finally, VoLe tells the correct answer. As such we can use VoLe to provide the Internet access to the unprivileged students.
